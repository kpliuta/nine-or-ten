# Nine or Ten? (Дев'ять чи десять?)

A simple drum machine app for Android, inspired by a viral Ukrainian meme.

## The Story Behind the Name

The name "Nine or Ten?" comes from a popular Ukrainian internet meme. The meme is based on a recording of a phone call to the police emergency line (102). In the call, an elderly woman, in a very polite and slightly confused manner, asks the dispatcher what time is it.

The dispatcher, though initially taken aback by the unusual request, patiently tries to help her figure out the time. The original audio of the call (`call.mp4`) is included in the app's assets.

## Inspiration

A video that served as a key inspiration is included in the project's assets (`inspiration_video.mp4`).

## Features

*   4 loop tracks that can be played simultaneously.
*   12 drum pads for live beat-making.
